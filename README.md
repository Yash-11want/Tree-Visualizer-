# Tree-Visualizer-
A Qt and C++ based Contact Management System with visualized tree structures and showing visualization of Binary tree.
# Tree Visualization

## Introduction

This is a Phonebook Management System built using **C++** and the **Qt Framework**. It enables users to efficiently manage their contact information through a graphical user interface. The application also includes visualizers for three different tree data structures: **Binary Search Tree (BST)**, **AVL Tree**, and **Red-Black Tree (RBT)**, making it educational and functional.

## Project Scope

The system provides the following core functionalities:

* **Add Contacts**: Store new contact information.
* **Modify Contacts**: Update details for existing contacts.
* **Delete Contacts**: Remove contact entries.
* **Search Contacts**: Find contacts by name, number, or email.

In addition, the application allows users to interact with visual representations of tree structures.

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language**: C++
* **Framework**: Qt (for GUI)
* **IDE**: Qt Creator
* **Compiler**: GCC (or compatible C++ compiler)

## UI Design

The interface is clean and user-friendly. Key screens include:

* Main Window
* Binary Search Tree View
* AVL Tree View
* Red-Black Tree View
* Phonebook View

## Module Breakdown
